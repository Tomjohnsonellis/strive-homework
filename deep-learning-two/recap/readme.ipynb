    "<br>***What is it?:***   A simple type of neural network, used for simple \"Yes/No\" problems\n",
    "<br>***Why use it?:***   It has a (relatively) simple architecture, it's a good tool for understanding the flow of a typical neural network. However, it is rather primitive compared to other networks we have available.\n",
    "<br>***When to use it?:*** If you are trying to answer the question \"Is this <X>? Yes or No\" then a perceptron will be helpful - you can also add them to the end of more complex networks!\n",
    "<br>***How to use it?:*** See [AND Gate](https://github.com/Tomjohnsonellis/strive-work/blob/main/deep-learning-two/and-gate-perceptron.py) / [OR Gate](https://github.com/Tomjohnsonellis/strive-work/blob/main/deep-learning-two/or-gate-perceptron-remake.py) for a coding walkthrough.\n",
