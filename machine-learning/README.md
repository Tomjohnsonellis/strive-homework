# Todo:

(I found this week quite challenging so will be revisiting a few topics)<br>
 - [] Make a personal pipeline function to speed up model creation.
 - [] Get to grips with classes, very powerful and scalable
 - Use the pipeline to solve a problem from each of these topics:
 - [] Regression
 - [] Clustering
 - [] K Nearest Neighbours
