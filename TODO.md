Recap: I took a month off as I had some personal issues that needed addressing, now that I'm returning I need to refresh myself on some topics.

- Machine Learning
  - Underlying algorithms
  - What are support vector machines?
  - Some practice with dummy data just to remember code flow
- Feature Engineering
  - Find out how to create good features
  - Pipelines and grid searches
- Deep Learning
  - Probably need a refresh on a basic neural network in python
  - Pytorch
  - Image classification (cat/dog)
  - [Weights & Biases website](wandb.ai)
  - Usage of pretrained networks

I believe going over these topics will get me back up to speed ready for computer vision.
