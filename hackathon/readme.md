# HackUPC Hackathon Notes

`May 14th  18:00 -> May 16th 16:00 (GMT)`

I will be invited to join a discord server at the start time.

###	What to build?
Any tech-related project is OK! (Examples: Webpage, Mobile App, Games, API, Harware Project...)
### How is it judged?
Mainly on technical difficulty, innovation and overall learning experience.<br>
Bonus points for usability and design.

## Teams
`Max Size: 4`<br>
Meet some new people at the event, form a team with them then and there!<br>
The event is fun and educational, so mingle with people and have a good time.>br>

# Key Points
[From this article](https://developer.att.com/blog/What-to-Expect-At-Your-First-Hackathon)<br>
	- Networking is crucial
	- Just get chatting, what do people want to do?
	- Be honest about what you CAN do and want to contribute!

[From this one](https://blog.hackbrightacademy.com/blog/12-things-to-do-before-your-first-hackathon/)<br>
	- Understand the rules
	- Know your Minimum Viable Product
	- Set realistic goals
	- Remember to have breaks/naps/sleep, it's a 36 hour marathon, not a sprint.


# Most Importantly: Enjoy.
