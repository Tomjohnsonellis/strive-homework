# Day 9: No-Code Solutions

Today we covered a range of available services that can make our day to day work easier, with a focus on things that don't require you to code anything yourself.

I checked out a few services, specifically:
- [Link Tree](linktr.ee) for amalgamating any professional links I may need
- [Loom](loom.com) for quickly recording and sharing screen+webcam captures
- [Figma](figma.com) for rapidly building presentations (these can later be used with other services)
- [Overleaf](overleaf.com) for quickly putting together LaTeX documents ([Here's a CV made with it](https://www.overleaf.com/read/cpcvxgxbtyhb))

Thoughts:<br>
I was a bit skeptical at first as previously I had a bit of an elitist mindset about pre-made solutions.<br>
But after seeing some of them in action and taking into account the fact that I do not actually have infinite time to spare I absolutely see the use in these types of services and will be adding some to my digital toolbelt.

The job a data scientist is to solve problems both quickly and effectively, as much as I detest bloatware on my own devices, getting a job done on time to a good standard is far more important than the efficient hardware use, that stuff is for the engineers.
