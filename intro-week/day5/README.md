# Github Practice

Workflow:
1. Select what files to work on (git add <files>)
2. Do some work on them
3. Commit the work (git commit -m "<descriptive message>")
4. If you have more work to do, repeat these steps
5. Submit your changes to github (git push)

### Things to remember
Keep your commits small, descriptive and frequent. An entire project in one commit defeats the entire point of git.<br>
Commits can give you insights into how you work, like how long a feature takes, typical amount of code per commit etc.<br>
Keep commits specific, e.g. "Fixed a typo" and "Refactored code" would be seperate commits<br>
