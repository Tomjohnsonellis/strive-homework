Capitals and lower case letters may both be used, and you have to consider that the word \"wood\" should be a separate word, and not part of another word. Hint: If you did the exercises from this chapter, you already developed a function that \"cleans\" a text. Combining that function with the split() function more or less solves the problem for you."
